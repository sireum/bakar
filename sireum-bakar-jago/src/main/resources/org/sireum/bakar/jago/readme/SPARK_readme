(1) either subprogram or package can be a compilation unit, if test.adb contains only 
    a subprogram body, then use gnatmake to compile it
  >>$ gnatmake -gnat2012 -gnatct test.adb

(2) after compilation, use gnat2xml to generate its AST in XML
  >>$ gnat2xml test.adb 

(3) each file can have only one compilation unit, for example, it doesn't allow one file
    has both procedure specification and procedure body

(4) compile and build executable Ada programs
    given the name of the main program, "gnatmake" utility automatically performs the necessary 
    compilation, binding and linking steps.
    for example, test.ads and test.adb
    $ gnatmake test.adb or gnatmake test  (gnatmake will figure out its dependencies automatically)
